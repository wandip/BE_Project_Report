Project Report for our Final Year Project- CODA (Comprehensive Developer Assistant)
Abstract: 
Robots and AI based systems are now slowly taking over many sectors such as support, industrial automation, etc. Our aim is to develop one such intelligent engine, which will allow users to give commands in natural english to perform a particular task/s on the client machine, which would then be analyzed and con-verted into appropriate terminal commands/code snippet generation using natural language processing and machine learning. System can be integrated with VCS like GitHub, Project management application like Slack. The system will be able to constantly evolve and train itself to handle variations in user input. Such a system finds useful application in a Virtual Intelligent Assistant, which can be based on remote access and can be handled easily by naive users as well. principles, to run on the client device.
